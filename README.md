Without Widgets
===============

A few handy jQuery widgets that we developed.

Current widgets:

* Popover.

**Note:** This really is still very early days, and you probably don't want to actually use this yet.

Popover
-------

There are a number of popover implementations, but none that met our requirements. This one does.

**Usage:** Call wowPopover on an element. For example:

> $('#something').wowPopover({
>   content: $('#some_content') 
> });

**Options**

* **content:** The content of the popover. This will be copied into the popover immediately, and removed from the DOM.
* **side_margin:** The minimum distance in px between the left/right edge of the popover and the browser edge. *Default: 4*
* **debug:** Display log messages to the console when true. *Default: 4*
* **onBeforeShow:** Function that is called before the popover is displayed. Passes the trigger and the popover div.
* **onAfterShow:** Function that is called after the popover is displayed. Passes the trigger and the popover div.
* **onBeforeHide:** Function that is called before the popover is hidden. Passes the trigger and the popover div.
* **onAfterHide:** Function that is called before the popover is hidden and removed from the DOM. Passes the trigger.
